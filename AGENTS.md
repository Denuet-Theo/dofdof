# A bug is never fixed in one place

**Before fixing a bug, grep for every other place the same mistake can be made,
and fix them all in the same change.** Not "note them for later", not "mention
them in the PR body" — fix them.

The reason is measured, not theoretical. Three separate silent-write-failure
fixes shipped as one-line local patches over three weeks. Each was correct.
Each left the other thirty call sites untouched, because nobody looked. The
fourth one cost 22 mounts: a batch of births failed to insert, the failure went
to `console.error`, the dialog closed announcing success, and it was found the
next day by comparing the game's stable count to the app's — 203 against 225.

So the fix is never the line that broke. It is:

1. **Name the class of the bug** in one sentence — "an error path that only
   logs", "an optimistic local write with no rollback", "a `.in()` on an id
   list that may hold fabricated ids".
2. **Grep the class, not the symptom.** `console.error` after a write,
   `setState` before an `await`, `Promise.all` mixing a write and its
   compensation. The symptom is one file; the class is usually twenty.
3. **Fix every hit, or say why not** — in the PR body, per exception.
4. **Make the class unrepresentable** where a mechanism can do it: one shared
   helper the call sites must go through beats thirty correct call sites that a
   thirty-first will not match. See `src/lib/errors/write-failures.ts`.

A PR that fixes one instance of a class the maintainer has already been bitten
by three times is not a fix, it is a fourth report of the same bug.
